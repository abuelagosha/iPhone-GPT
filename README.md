# Voice Calling Chat GPT 

This is the backend code for an experiment aiming to change our interaction with Chat GPT into a vocal conversation.
I synthesized the Open AI API and Google Text to Speech (gtts) API. 
As the user starts the conversation vocally, the comment is recorded into text and sent to Chat GPT. 
Chat GPT's response in text form is transferred with the default voice in the gtts API and fed back to the user vocally.
